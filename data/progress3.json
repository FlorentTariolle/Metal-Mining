Bleeding for these eyes to remain shut in darkness.\nIn this conscious cycle I am trapped. Spare me this transient surge of chemical\nnausea, mimicking contentedness. Pressed into my forehead, these fingertips\nfail to comfort my mind. Comatose descension. My psyche withers and cracks as\nthe worm naked to the burning sun. Razor lined parasites that trace their way\nthrough my brain. I have harbored this virus inside my mind my whole life,\nwallowing in a pool of vomit. Inside my skull thoughts grow sore and begin to\ndecay, infected, swollen, and bursting. My jaw tightens into a clench. Cranial\npulse escalates to a pounding throb. I turn my focus inward, to be relieved by\nperpetual void. For we cannot attain in life the adoration we receive in death.\nI am glad to have died, and now that I am gone, I know only the dead truly\nrest."

              "lyrics": "Moss grew over my eyes, and the roots went to my brain, down my throat, through\nmy knees, and out my toes. There will be no salvation. A perspective struggles\nfor air, engulfed by the earth’s healing scab. Let the dirt pour from the\ninside of my skull, as I am excavated from the burning wreckage. My torso opens\nto reveal a mass grave, exhuming the skeletons buried in my chest. Why must\nthere be illumination upon this festering pile? Cursing that which wakes me. I\ncoil to make my nest, to hide my scales from the light. I have not yet had my\ntime in the sun. There will be no salvation, for I am the serpent doomed to\ncrawl on my stomach. Slithering beneath your feet and between your toes.\nLearning your minds, mimicking your frivolity. But all jubilation is mine in\nthe end. Basilisk fangs glistening in the sun’s final rays, to alleviate a\nradial hatred, ancient and hypnotic. Staining your lives and all the earth with\na bitterness, subtle and unbearable, yet tangible at the very base of your\nmind. A worm becomes a king. Arising to crush the crown of God. Eternally\ndispelling my misery to permeate through every molecule of life that pulses\nover this planet. The sun burns blinding red before eternally ceasing its\ngraceful shine. In a serpent’s mouth the earth shall be swallowed whole. And we\nwill ask ourselves before we finally die: How miserable is the light that\nshines into my eyes?"

It's just a feeling, this\nsensation that I get. Similar to the birth and growth of black cobras in my\nmouth. Where is the happiness you are to find inside yourself? The salt will\nnot cease to pour into your unlidded eyes. A surgery malicious, meticulous,\nripping you apart. Furious excavation. Don't tell me you don't need this. As we\nstand here, we can smell you rotting inside your beautiful tomb. A blank dead\nface stares at me. You have focused the whole of your existence upon a single\nthought. The depravity of our world. That we are all plagued. Voluntarily\nimpaling yourself on a spike of well intended nothingness. Your words are\nbeginning to rust into the guilt that rots inside us all, revealing your\npointless speculations as a disguise. The ordure you harbor inside your skull\nhas given nothing. Now this torment is only your torment, and it's salt to me.\nFinding poison in every flower and you wonder why they wilt with your touch,\nleaving your world empty until there is nothing left for you. My index finger\nis pointed directly at your pathetic heart. I'll be the one to close your eyes.\nI'll close your eyes when you die"

Eyelids sewn shut, stumbling away into a tangled spider web of agonizing\nbondage, while dripping fangs emanate from the walls. Fear is all around me.\nLords pull at robotic tendons guiding every subtle twitch of fingers, and\nthought is coffined, smothered beneath the loathsome. Conglomerations of\ndecaying offscourings amassing into a colossal mountain range, larger than the\nbiomass of the entire earth. Squeezed and contorted into the crafty wires.\nSlimed in a dripping sewage runoff coating. There, behind a snowy television\nscreen, bleeding in peeled human skin, snaked into the eye sockets of the\nevening viewer. With arms hanging limp over the side of the love seat,\npotassium chloride dribbles from the corners of our mouths. A puddle forms on\nthe dirt floor where comprehension and empathy dissolve. Coordinated like toys,\nbecoming blinded, stoic, acquisitive whores. Manipulation of the collective\nconsciousness pontificates a prayer for our country, entombed. Defining\nabominable. Extract the ticks burrowing deep into the brain stem. Together\nwe’ll eradicate the throne of our tormentors. …This is the delusion that I\nburned and I watch as its ashes decorate the ground. The manifestation of my\ndiscomfort and insecurities. I am relieved now that it has died. A\nmisperception of reality. Nothing more than a charred and stinking corpse,\nnailed to the cross next to the remains of a white, manufactured Christ."

And I laugh at this\nsand I hold in my hands. This, I used to think I held the key. The door was\nalways open. And I remain to stare at my reflection, as I am randomly switched\nback and forth from either side. My insignificance becoming insignificant. And\nall my pointless shouts at the universe fall back upon my skull like pelting\nrain. I smash my fist into the mirror until my body is soaked in blood. And I\nlaugh uncontrollably at this shattered reflection. I let my hands bleed as they\nfinally touch the truth. All the pain and torment. The sum of humanity’s\nsuffering. It was worth everything I have lost. To finally understand these\nbeautiful roses blossoming forth from the hollow torso of humanity’s blood\ndrenched history. I lost my tongue with the shards that splintered into my\nmind. I am not amused. Bloodlet my skull now. Acid rain on my lungs. Ending all\nlife now. I stand on God. Drain this world from my eyes. My insignificance has\nbecome insignificant."

Decay.\nI run, spitting forth my thick blood...\nI crouch to mortify my sleep. Sleep.\nMuscles are crushed from the inside?\nI pass away! To die...\nI volatilize as a soul... Soul...\n\nGrowing in at dark speed!\nThe demonic presence has baptised in Me...\nI wont let Him be born!\nThis immortal creature,\nThis demoniacal vigorous demon.\nI plunge in my corpse...\nTo clash the Uproar.\n\nI storm by rays, bleeding Its energy\nSuffering... He reveals His toxic corruption.\nSpreading... Its decease envelopping my anguished\npureness.\nParalysis sets in Me?\nI blaze of holiness... Tremouring His sickness...\nI grasp His power... Draining Him to be enfeeble.\nI eradicate His remains...\nTo negate His last particle of life...\nBlast to invisble ashes... Choking forth...\nInfernal blitz... Into immortal reality...\nThe Anti-soul evolution fades away...\n... It regresses eternally.\nThe shadow of His fear...\nWhich inhabited me for years!\nLost His answers...\n... Of Unmortal-spirituality.\n\nMy life half rejoined my other half\nSoul and body to make one lethal force.\nIn connection the reincarnation of my cells...\n... Returned me as my own!\n\nI feel...\n... Recoverance from my rest.\nThe Night still has a part of Me?\nAwake...\nTo forge my Soul...\n\nUntrapped from reality,\nIn the middle of a ceremony.\nThe shield of time breaks in a church?\nRegardless as the candles were losing life...\nScripts of blood bound in the wax!\nTo melt deep below the lights...\n\n... Extinguished the hoing priests.\n... Blind confused thoughts.\n\nAs the Sun's Rays, Destroy... The stained glasses...\nI scream... VICTORY...\nWhen I run to bash... The front doors...\n...INFINITY.\nLight beams of... Wonderful Fire!\n... Burns Me.\nSoul freed! Happiness avenged Me..."

How much you can take, and keep\nmoving forward. If you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're\nworth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit.\"\n\n [Rocky Balboa]\n\nOnce you die there's no coming back\nIs it survival or is it emptiness?

Tell me now! Am I the fear in your hearts?\n\nThis cannot be happening to me\nIt's all wrong, just a dream. What have I done?\nNo hope, no way out of this\nPlease just let me die now. I don't want this fate\nI don't want to be a hero anymore\nCan't breathe, can't do it, just let me fall\nWe're all lost. Fighting enemies that don't exist\nAnd they turned us into this\n\nI'm gonna take it all back, I'm gonna tear up this track\nAnd all this pain and hate within will never have been\nBut the fear keeps coming back, in my mind so cold and black\nIs this the end of us all? I'm the fear in your hearts\n\nThis cannot be happening to me\nIt's all wrong, just a dream. What have I done?\nNo hope, no way out of this\nPlease just let me die now. I don't want this fate\nI don't want to be a hero anymore\nCan't breathe, can't do it, just let me fall\nWe're all lost. Fighting enemies that don't exist\nAnd they turned us into this\n\nI'm gonna go to sleep and wake up, far away, as someone else\nAnd all of this, and my whole life\nWas just a terrible dream\nMurderer, endless wrath, belligerence, unforgivable sins\nLive in fear, live the lies\nCan we never forgive or forget\n\nThis cannot be happening to me\nIt's all wrong, just a dream. What have I done?\nNo hope, no way out of this\nPlease just let me die now. I don't want this fate\nI don't want to be a hero anymore\nCan't breathe, can't do it, just let me fall\nWe're all lost.

It began like a happy night.\nAll the resolutions that we made are no more.\nIt looks like a festive night, a stillborn festive night.\nThe funfair was here in town only today... too late.\nIs it your favourite dress that you wear right now?\nIs it some red that you put on your lips?\n\nSay it to me, (say it to me) so that we could divide.\nSay it to me but carefully.\n\nYou never seemed so glad to see me, did you?\nIs it a consolation before death?\nSay it to me and we could divide, it's all you owe to me.\nIs it some red that I see on your lips?\n\nSay it to me, (say it to me) so that we could divide.\nSay it to me but carefully.\n\nSee how much the man I became frightens the child I was.\nSee how much this ending chapter is so empty.\nI handle the illusion so well. I juggle with the doubts so well.\nHow could I imagine even in worst dreams our faith could go into eclipse?\n\nFor all you did to me, darling, our premature love is not anymore.\nFor all you mean to me, darling, I can't wait for you.\n\nScars again, flesh to hide, spare to me the reasons to cry.\nI can't believe that you are anymore. All you are is a short term god.\nYou can build another sky. You can spend the rest of your mind.\nI can't believe that we are anymore. All I need is a twilight ending.\nFade away, fade away in a laconic mourning.\nI can't believe, that you are anymore, all you are is a short term god.\n\nA short term god is all you are."

What kind of torture have you lain out for me, oh deepest of desires? I am beckoning at your door, following the augmented mist in dire concentration. Create me an enemy who lies beyond the mirror. An external motive who suits such spite, building strength rather than this internalized decay. Put me on the edge of my toes, reflex being more than apparent, and consume this threat of character. Putting word count on hold. How reassuring that the panic comes from within; fluttering, choking, racing through time, with fluctuations dimming perceptions. A fitting approach for a coward. Emphasis always seems to be lost on cause, and I've lost the energy to take initiative this time. Sometimes it's nothing more than a clean shirt and a familiar pair of shoes. It always seems like a blind search. It's frustrating seeing some cope so well, while I stumble and slip. You can call it \"soul\" searching, if it suits you. And here I'm perched; stagnant shades of blue and beige, speakers, lost souls; white noise. Living on borrowed time."

Kicking yourself in the aftermath. Clenched tight, with wandering eyes. A poet's soul, while lacking central theme and concentration lay shattered on the floor. But I remain. Footsteps deep inside, while attractive eyes dart about once every so often. Holding the moment when text becomes reality and all else is relative. Grinding, twisting echoes, like pins to the senses sparking telepathic conversations leading a new feedback forward. And I remain. A familiar face set to a different tone. With clearness that speaks a beautiful story demanding to be read. But my lack of words holds me back. The situation breeds the opposition. We remain. Readiness hits the fan as ideas spark confusion, and assertiveness only serves as aggravation. The clock sets the stage. The piano plays on. Separate, we move on."

Viewing successful behaviour and dismissing it as brutish, immature, petty. But successful. Suppressed frustration. It's one long run of the blaming game. Based on insecurity? Lack of identity? Need for poetic masterpiece? Need for release. Cautious to a fault, while actions go unnoticed due to different perspectives of the game. A lack of knowledge of the rules, or rebellion against them. This rebellion is faced alone; in dark tranquillity. Separation of mind from body. Culture from mind. Digging deeper but coming up short. Falling to convenience and familiarity. It's bearable, a relatively painless repetition. I like to think that I don't care. It's harder than it seems. Resist temptation. The cycle begins again. Where did we go wrong? Where did \"we\" go?"

Searching for answers to questions you can't even define. Observation proves to be both a gift and a curse. Filled with a sense of confusion, an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach. This void has no satisfaction, and it reminds me of this fact every night. They make me sick. And the pain of it refuses to cease. Nothing is ever done. Picking life apart before it can be lived. Each situation dissected and dismissed. Left cold and redundant, trapped within this self-propelled cycle; motivated by fear. And likeliness is against you."

The air is stale, everything aches and sentiments are set to the quintessence of contempt.

Cause and effect; one giant search for approval that seems to always fall short. Become, then deconstruct. You can't put a discount price tag on history and expect a connection; and I won't hand it over to you on a silver platter. This is a rather meaningless rental of an expired life phase, taking for granted all that creates foundation. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Inevitable failure and withdrawal, welcome a new crutch. It has happened before, it will happen again. This hide is thick and will see another day. Withstanding the test of time is the only statement necessary. Many a face will change, but the musk ox will remain. Overstatements become reality. Lifecycles haven't the depth they once held; lost dried up wells. Trends and fads fade and die breathing life to the new; a sad cycle refurbished by innovators and consumed by the easily persuaded. Ninety thousand years with only humanity to blame."

The past catches up with the present and I'll watch both walk off into the night; crisp flakes covering the ground in their wake. It's almost as if a scarlet letter has been etched in my flesh. Five and a half years to rot. Five and a half years to realize this place is dead. Five and a half years: worthless. The skies remain held in dismal grey hues, providing visual homage to the squeezing pressure within my skull. Everything works together this time. Working at sending a message: you will lose.

But I can't be fooled this time around because I know who I am and what I want. From the inside out; building on psychological scar tissue. It comes when you least expect it, a glimpse of weakness in the eyes and our target is set: curled up by the phone. All that is heard is the breaking of glass and tearing of flesh from within. Sycophantic pied piper of trusting fools. The weak are not accepted here. Fingers out-stretched, a mild quiver, turning relentlessly in the silence waiting for a sign. You couldn't understand.

This time, on a whim, a lone flare fired off that ledge into evident purgatory, assumed lost, but returned with playful curiosity. I'd never be the same again. These words have struggled to reach the surface; as their previous purpose was spitefully driven: the sole existence bent retribution. This frustration melted away with a tingling of my nerves; straight down my spine. Living for that smile; those piercing eyes.

If the scenario dictates that the pants make the man, I'll own this town. It's a wicked pike (and I think I like it), and I'm watching as you're losing face."

A heavy psychological burden to be carrying; Like a backpack full of fifty five pound plates. But it brings with it a clear message: never accept mediocrity. A hunger that can never be fed; True satisfaction never felt. Couple this with a deep rooted, unspecified anger that has existed and remained constant for the greater part of my post-pubescent life, save for a few short periods of general contentment. And we're starting to paint a seemingly dreary picture. But fret not my dear, for within this state I am driven. Within this state I cannot fail. Within this state I will attack the challenges I've laid before myself without reserve and with unbridled passion. Within this state I find life. This is the ugliest happy you've ever seen."

One line on an empty page: \"When can any of this be changed?\" When these spiteful pieces of you won't come back down and time stands still. This has been a trap for far too many years. We've seen others abandon ship; But we'll follow this one to the bottom it seems."

The battle rages on\nTHROUGH THE FIRE! For the queen far at home\nTHROUGH THE FIRE! The battle surges on\nTHROUGH THE FIRE! My comrades fall unknown\n\nAs the sun, sets slowly in the west\nThe field is red, we did our duty best\nNo one can leave, until all are killed\nNo one survived, from all the blood that spilled\n\nThe long bows, swords of valor\n\nAs we march through the mud, to the field we all will die\nWe all look above, and pray towards the sky\nTo die in war, the queen tells us so\nFor what reason, till death we did not know\n\nTHROUGH THE FIRE! The battle rages on\nTHROUGH THE FIRE! For the queen far at home\nTHROUGH THE FIRE! The battle surges on\nTHROUGH THE FIRE! My comrades fall unknown\n\nThe battle rages\nThrough the fire\nThe battle rages\nThrough the fire"

Haunts us, just can't stay calm\nIt keeps repeating, coming back\nLower your head, now you hit the ground\nNowhere to hide, a final storm\nNowhere to run to, this is home\nIn the blink of an eye, all changed\nTurn restless winds to storm\nLay to rest by your side. No comfort\nYou've left us all"

              "lyrics": "[bell chimes]\n\n [quiet]\n\nGood afternoon.\n\n [pause]\n\nWhy?\n\n [pause]\n\nBecause I feel compelled to speak my mind.\n\nSo before anyone writes any review of this occasion or jumps to any\nconclusions, I ask them to hear me out from beginning to end of this talk.\n_Then_ they are entitled to criticise but _not_ before. So I ask you first\nto entertain possibilities and open your minds.\n\n [bell chimes]\n\n\"The man of truth is beyond good and evil. The man of truth is ridden to\nall is one. The man of truth has learned that illusion is the one reality\nand its substance is a great impostor.\"\n\n [bell chimes]\n\nH. P. Lovecraft.\n\nThroughout my forthcoming book, \"An Irrational Domain\", I work from the\nfundamental assumption that for the artist dreams and visions are a more\nauthentic source of information than fact or reason. Now this hypothesis\nhas steadily evolved to the extent that it is no longer merely a\nconviction but my perception of truth itself. Consequently, all activity\nderived from such foundations cannot coexist with any form of rationalist\nor intentive thought. The primary objective is to set everything in\nmotion in the required direction. For example, existing concepts of time\nare only real if we accept and succumb to the boundaries and divisions\nlaid down. I'm simply pointing out that we do of course have the option to\nritually smash the clock up along with its corresponding restrictions and\ntransform, extend, increase or decrease such boundaries, enabling us to\nachieve a greater freedom by changing our perspective of truth and reason.\nWe may conclude that, if truth as we see it to be, can be rearranged to\nbenefit us in any way, then this flexible truth is justified. The same\nwould apply in the eradication of supposed historic fact.\n\nNow, in accepting the endless possibilities of the irrational domain we\ncan evoke a chosen picture of the past to influence the present and\nfuture. The rejection or alteration of conventional perception of\nmeasurement, fact, time and reason can shatter restrictive barriers and\nopen up frightening possibilities. To illustrate the point, an elementary\nannihilation of the assumption that Columbus was the first navigator\nacross the Atlantic changes the entire Western concept of civilisation.\nAgain, should we choose a certain axiom as a starting point, we do so\nregardless of so called fact or reason.\n\nHowever, today at the Courtauld Institute we shall be focusing our\nattention on those forces visible behind the changes in modern society.\nAnd how we may view these criteria with true objectivity from within the\nmedium of music...\n\n [quiet and to the audience:]\nCheer up!\n\nThere are many strange phenomena where objective points are reached\nthrough work in the metaphysical. Now the dowsers, or \"water diviners\"\nemployed by the water board to locate underground streams are a good\nexample of this. And yet the individual accomplishing them is generally\nnot aware that he is doing so by the aid of a force. He discovers he has a\npower but does not know what that power is. He only knows the results.\nThat's all he can see. Had the atheist scientist of the rational world\ngiven as careful study to forces as he did to elements, constantly working\nback and back, following one force to another, eventually he might have\nsome understanding of the origin of movement. At this moment in time our\nscientific rationale tells us that the blood in our body is pumped around\nby our heart, but what makes it tick?\n\nHe doesn't know!\n\nSimilarly, if we look at the rapidly transforming world of atomic power\nand super-technology on its exterior, we begin to wonder about the nature\nof force from which the ripples of momentum originated and I think we can\nall agree that there is something decidedly unhealthy about our current\nmode of existence.\n\n [sigh]\nBut I'm just a mad artist. I shall view the changes perceived from\nthat role I know best. If you would focus your aural faculties on the\nsound, one minute...\n\n [guitar begins to play]\n\nI'll go back in time. To before I formed the group Killing Joke and I want\nyou to come back in time with me.\n\nSilence... please...\n\nI can remember first discussing the virtues of bombarding the individual\nwith disturbing aspects of modem day reality on stage with Paul Ferguson,\nprior to the formation of Killing Joke. It was indeed refreshing to find\nsomeone else who saw the entirety of creative function as something other\nthan a pleasure principle. In actual fact we utterly rejected the common\nartist's objective of creating a more desirable aesthetic effect.\n\nDo you follow?\n\nWe firmly believed that by employing a reversal of this process, true\nprogress could commence. Now, this was far from a contemporary ploy but a\nutilisation resembling a healing therapy of antiquity. Now, let me\nexplain: the fundamentals of such performance are clearly routed in the\nvenerable healing magic of the ancients, I assure you. Central to this\nvery old form of therapy is the idea that if you suffer from the\nunderworld you can only be cured in the underworld. Underworld.\n\nIt is a homeopathic principle. The cure for a sickness is accomplished by\ndosing the patient with minute quantities of substances which in larger\ndoses would actually create the very symptoms of the sickness. Such a cure\nfor a sickness involves experiencing a little of the essence of sickness.\n\nWhat sickness? Huh?\n\nWhat sickness I hear you say.\n\nWhich underworld? Where?\n\nThe initial symptoms have escalated into a monstrous plague. It does not\nrequire much imagination to locate the underworld within a scarred,\nbutchered landscape. Industrial wasteland, inhumane concrete hovels,\nresembling rabbit hutches stacked up on top of one another. Created\nspecifically for maximum capacity at minimum expenditure.\n\n [guitar stops suddenly]\n\n [guitar starts again]\n\nGrotesque Judeo-Christian compassion exposed in its truest form, directly\nreflected in the environment. Homes for the common people that have been\nconsciously designed to perpetuate an ignorance, clearly intended to be\nleft at their own devices within controlled surroundings.\n\nDo you follow?\n\nThose individuals who are either insensitive or too weak-willed to command\nand control their immediate environment are collectively housed.\nWidespread mediocrity in its most terminal context eliminating even the\nhuman dignity of a slave, I believe.\n\nYou go to Sheffield; we'll go to Sheffield. Let's take a look around\nSheffield. Take a good look! Drained, soul-less young men and women\ndrastically alienated from the natural order over-compensating in puerile\nfantasy, debauchery games and various trivia encouraged by ...\nconsumerism. That which remains of the instinct unconsciously anticipates\nthe absolute horror of mass annihilation, vast and impersonal. Envisaging\nthemselves so disgustingly humiliated by their own vulnerability,\npowerless to react, powerless to react on any defensive or significant\nbasis. A collective nightmare of the day, you know the day, when looting,\npillage and screaming insanity reigns. A hideous prelude of pure terror\nconcentrated within the boundaries of minutes, seconds. Man suffering the\nindignity of resembling panic-stricken battery chickens awaiting\nslaughter, pathetically running 'round in circles at random.\n\nErg...\n\nDecisions determined in the lives of billions made exclusively by\nmicrochips impregnated and programmed with the epitome of rational\nthought.\n\n [synthesised effect]\n\nYou can imagine the irony of the dilemma.\n\nListen to me well.\n\nAbsolute conflict. Destruction and mega-deaths are logical and imperative\nassumptions. Overpopulation at loggerheads with human compassion. The\nhygiene of conventional war obliterated by the escalation of technology\nthus all reason made obsolete and redundant by the rationalist himself.\nMass unemployment also caused by rapid development of technology. Manpower\nno longer economically viable. Abandoned industrial areas claiming a\ngreater surface area than farmland, thus only enough harvest produce to\nfeed one eighth of the existing population.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nNations ideologically opposed to one another dependent on each other for\nexistence, import, export, mutually assured destruction, M.A.D. Foreign\npolicies based on the same principles evident in the period of time prior\nto the second World War, now applied in this temporary stage of\nsuper-technology.\n\nNow, I think we'll both agree, I think we'll all agree that such extreme\npressures of the decade seem to almost transform human awareness into a\ncurse. Yet, we still find perspective within the primal performance that\nembodies such extremities or should I say sicknesses?\n\nI believe it is necessary to look beyond the face value of such seemingly\nhorrific events. Extremities that we observe on a daily basis must be\nviewed as a link or a transition. One cannot bypass initiation, thus the\nwork of Killing Joke becomes considerably more coherent when seen in terms\nof a generator musically suggesting such a process.\n\nThe effect is akin to that of a vortex. Fascinating. And ultimately all\nencompassing. Now, I tell you the penultimate objective of recent work has\nbeen to actually identify the precise forces behind such global trends and\nmovements and incorporate them within the form and foundation of our\nmusic. In order to explain these forces with some degree of accuracy, it\nis necessary to expand on the origin and nature of these particular\nforces. The following excerpt is taken from a Cincinnati Journal of\nceremonial magic.\n\nAnd I quote: \"In the macrocosm these forces are the Elder Gods; in the\nmicrocosm they are the forgotten ones, constituting the dark aspects of\nthe anti-universe and of human unconscious respectively.\"\n\nAdmittedly, there is certain danger inherent in contacting them, but there\nis sure disaster in neglecting to do so. The Elder Gods, let me explain,\nthe Elder Gods dwell in the spaces between positive manifestation. That\nis, they exist between the possibility universes or in the\ninter-dimensional angles that separate our evolutionary time-stream from\nthe next.\n\nIt's not so complicated. Their previous dealings with our planetary life\nforce earn them an exile from this access to our space-time. Now, the\nproblem is our own discovery and employment of thermo-nuclear energy,\nhowever, has unsealed the gateway. Part of the coming crisis will be their\nattempt to resume control of the race.\n\nHear me out, please.\n\nThe major means of contact between the conscious man and the Elder Gods\nare the forgotten ones. Now, the forgotten ones dwell in the individual\nand irrational unconscious. They are the gods of survival, they are\npre-rational, they are blind and immensely powerful. Their force\nmanifested in man as hunger, the sex urge, the 'fight or flight'\nadrenaline reaction and the tribal cohesion factor. Hunger constitutes the\nprimary link between the Elder Gods and the forgotten ones. The search for\nnourishment antedates the desire for mating, even the asexual amoeba must\neat to survive. The process consists of the intake and assimilation of\nenergy either directly as in vegetable photosynthesis or indirectly by\nconsuming energy-storing matter. The forgotten ones seek both matter and\nenergy. Particularly in substances that consist of both modes: blood,\nmediumistic ectoplasm, the alchemical elixir; now, this type of substance\nis used to trap the forgotten ones into manifestation.\n\nDare we entertain it, to effectively counter a planetary invasion by the\nElder Gods the forgotten ones must be summoned to consciousness. In the\nprocess the individual's demons will be released and must be reabsorbed,\nthe forgotten ones must be comprehended and absorbed and the link that\nexists between them and the Elder Gods must be obtained and controlled by\nthe will of the magician. The forgotten ones have been left to work and\nfunction in the lower levels of sentience, gathering power and\naccumulating explosive potential under pressure. Now, it is in the\ncontrolled release of these gods that the consciousness will be propelled\nbeyond its present state and achieve the next and necessary condition of\ngestalt-consciousness.\"\n\nI believe!\n\n\"Having achieved the gestalt, the magician will be in contact with the\nrace consciousness that spans history and planetary geography. This\nentity, or 'planet man', is the only human mode capable of enforcing the\nedicts of exile upon the Elder Gods.\" That was written by Neema and\nShadow.\n\nNow, let me explain. As an artist, one's whole life is dedicated to an\nunending series of contrasts. As one matures through the years he becomes\nincreasingly aware of the necessity of maintaining balance and polarity.\nMargaret Crosby, the author of the writing I have previously read, who\ngoes under the name of Zora and Alhambra, explains further the\nimplications of polarity: \"The forgotten ones are your sources of personal\nmagical power. The higher you reach to the gods of light the lower you\nmust plunge to the gods of darkness. And furthermore, to ignore their\npresence is to guarantee their eventual dominion over your will.\" Kenneth\nGrant, the author of 'Outside the Circles of Time' adds: \"The forgotten\nones are the forces which the Christians declared satanic and which by\nsuppression have now grown to formidable dimensions threatening imminent\ndisaster for Humanity.\" So we are beginning to understand the Aquarian\nideal of standing upright with our heads above the heavens and our feet\nbelow the hells. Or simply the implications of balance and truth, I\nbelieve. Our current means of embodying the specific forces within our\nmusic is developed from this point. For example, in a recent experiment I\nwished to convey an extra-dimensional experience encountered within a\nritual invocation of a particular primal entity, that I believe to be\nlatent in the Middle East region at this moment.\n\nYes, it's abstract.\n\nNow, to do this I chose to instigate a time change completely unrelated to\nthe rest of the music. For I perceived the particular entity as being in\nbetween the space-time continuum. The time change was introduced with a\nsimple phrase\n [claps the time signature]\n: breakout of the cliché. For\nanyone interested in it the time signature was 13/12. I chose this using\nthe number 13 signifying Pluto, or Plutonium, symbolising regeneration, as\nthe basis of the rhythm. I simply hummed the music I could hear to Martin\nmy engineer - he is over there - I went:\n [Jaz hums title track from\n 'Outside the Gate']\n, something like that. Martin, my engineer, then\npinpointed the precise time in numerical form. Now, as this generally\nranges from 40 beats per minute to 280 in modern metronomes one can square\nor divide a number or either for more a precise variation. So, as I hummed\nthe music perceived, Martin noted the number of the natural speed and it\noccurred to me that we had devised a means whereby we could identify the\nexact force inherent within the foundations of the music if we checked a\nnumber arrived at with the system of numerology known as the Hebrew\nGeometria.\n\nNow, as I had insane but fervent convictions that the force I had\nencountered was active in the region of the gulf in the middle east, I was\nastounded to learn that the number of the natural speed was 103 which\nironically is that of the prophet. Now, as we in Killing Joke have now\nperfected a13-note scale corresponding to planetary influences the\nnightmare of the immediate future became visible on an aural basis. So let\nus watch with our ears and see for ourselves:\n\n [excerpt of the song 'Outside The Gate' is played.]\n\nSo, how do we explain the prevailing trend towards self-destruction in\ncivilisations of both the East and West? Is it, as Professor Velacovski\nsuggests, that the terrifying memory of massive global cataclysms has been\nwiped from the amnesiac human psyche and that those, the collective\nunconscious, who refuse to understand the past are condemned eternally to\nrepeat it. Or, I ask, is there another reason? I feel that the true answer\nis far simpler than Professor Velacovski suggests. Whilst his hypothesis\nhas something, I feel the underlying answer is far more straightforward,\nthough perhaps less attractive to the intellectual.\n\nMan's behaviour patterns when scrutinised with true objectivity force us\nto accept the unyielding conclusion that he is an irrational primeval\nbeast. He needs, he needs magic and miracles to dominate his existence.\nHis unconscious mind yearns for this.\n\nNow, it would be correct to assume that in our rational society the magic\nof current religious practice is no longer evident in daily life.\nConsequently, the unconscious habitually searches for a primal source of\npower worthy of marvelling at whilst retaining a one-dimensional\nperception corresponding to the age of reason. For example, Pascal Jordan,\nthe great German physicist, recollects the early years of atomic research\nthus, and remember this well: \"Everybody was filled with such tension that\nit almost took their breath away. The ice had been broken! It'd become\nmore and more clear in this connection we had stumbled upon a quite\nunexpected and deeply embedded layer of the secrets of nature.\"\n\nDoctor Oppenheimer, the pioneer of the atomic bomb, also remembers: \"Our\nunderstanding of atomic physics of that which we call the quantum-theory\nof atomic systems had its origins in the turn of the century and its great\nsynthesis and resolutions in the 1920s. It was a heroic time, a time of\nearnest correspondence in the horrid conferences, of debate, of criticism\nand brilliant mathematical improvisation; for those who participated it\nwas a time of creation. There was terror as well as exaltation in their\nnew insight.\"\n\nNow, from these two excerpts we can deduce that there was great excitement\nabout the discoveries taking place. The unconscious worship of power\ntapped through fission had already begun!\n\nBrilliant men and women who represented the quintessence of the scientific\nrationale were now linking their consciousness to the fantastic! An\nirrational domain that deified even the minds of the very acolytes\nresponsible for its creation.\n\nCraving, do you understand? Craving. Do you understand this word? It's a\ndisgusting word. Craving, the scientist craving for the liberation of such\nimmensity of energy was finally realised. He'd become spellbound by his\npart in unleashing the forces of nature. Soon the world would feast their\nminds and participate in the fervent adorations of horror-beauty.\nCivilisation would kneel on bended knee outwardly horrified but inwardly\nfascinated and all times paying obedience\n [?]\nto the knowledge of magics,\nperpetual manufacture, its consequences and most of all its exquisite\nthreat!\n\n [cymbals crash]\n\nFrom the moment of the first detonation at Alamogordo, Man could no longer\ndeny his unconscious worship of such power. There were many men and women\nwho have experienced what we have not and I would like to recount one\nman's experience. We are too flippant about the energies we have\nharnessed. So let us take it second-hand from someone who saw. So listen\nwell, for I'll say it only once:\n\n\"The whole country was lighted by a searing light with an intensity many\ntimes that of the midday sun. Thirty seconds after the explosion came\nfirst the air blast, pressing hard against the people and things, to be\nfollowed immediately by the strong sustained awesome roar which warned of\ndoomsday and made us feel the we puny things were blasphemous to dare\ntamper with the forces heretofore reserved to the almighty.\n\n\"Words are inadequate tools for the job of a quantum dose not present,\nmetaphysical, mental and psychological effects, it had to be witnessed to\nbe realised.\" - General Farrel, 16th of July 1945, the Manhattan Project.\n\nHow about this one?\n\n\"The second coming in vengeance!\" Winston Churchill on the atomic bomb.\n\nThe situation, I'm speaking to you now, the situation today facing us\nforty or so years after the first atomic explosion at Alamogordo only\nreinforces my point: the collective unconscious everywhere now eagerly\nanticipates the return of the Old Ones.\n\nDark aspects or gods of blind terror, pre-rational and immensely powerful.\nEntities we have invoked back into our existence through the portals of\nour very actions. Our own discovery of thermo-nuclear energy has unsealed\nthe gateway. These dark elements of nature have already partially resumed\ncontrol of the race.\n\nWhere are they? Huh?\n\nWhere are they? I assure you will see them when you've finished this\nlecture.\n\nWhere are they? They are evident in the mayday celebrations in Moscow and\nPeking as the intercontinental ballistic missiles are gloriously paraded\ndown the street.\n\nThey are there.\n\nIn its American counterpart we find childish, pro-Star Wars advertisements\nthat promote the puerile space-age technological dream of lasers,\nprotective screens and push-button annihilation. Their presence is also\ndiscernible in Israel's atomic progress at the heart of which lies a base\nOld Testament hate and loathing towards the enemies of the Zionist cause.\nBut most of all they are visible in the governing bodies of the White\nHouse whose policies and politics are determined, to be precise, are\ndetermined by a consumationist interpretation of St John's testimony of\nthe apocalypse.\n\nArmaments of obliteration in all their forms have become symbols, or\nidols, of a rational world with which man has begun to worship bodies of\nunlimited power. The confusion and hypocrisy that surrounds the potential\nemployment of these weapons only broadens the irrationality of the human\npsyche, for it should be known, it should be noted, that the image of the\nenemy remains unalterable.\n\nDo you hear me?\n\nBanners of the free West are piously flown under which crusades against,\nand I quote Mr. Ronald Reagan, \"Godless monsters of an evil empire\" are\nundertaken. Similarly, any attempt at imperialist intervention would be\nmade with a, quote Mr. Gorbachev: \"a glorious and crushing strike.\" A\nglorious and crushing strike. The seeds of natural regeneration have begun\nto germinate visibly in the feverish pitch of human activity within the\nvarious superpowers as they prepare for the climax of their existence.\n\nHuh, you know, astonishingly enough, however, in the midst of all this\nmadness, all still claim to be operating in the name of freedom. Now,\nwhether this is collective or individual is irrelevant. Somewhere there is\ntruth in their assumptions for they are most certainly moving towards a\nliberation of one kind although, I suspect it is probably far removed from\nthe written political and ideological creeds. Should civilisations\nsuddenly bear a collective awareness of the unconscious mind, then I have\nno doubt that it would be uniquely horrified at the kind of liberation it\nis actually initiating.\n\nThe prevailing idealism at this moment in time is most definitely\nunconscious as opposed to conscious. This for me is possibly the most\nunacceptable aspect of it all. The reluctance of humanity to face the\nstate of its collective unconscious has been made apparent at two specific\ntimes in the last eight years of my career with Killing Joke. In both the\nFalklands War and more especially the American bombing of Tripoli, I\nnoticed a sudden surge of interest in both my activities and studies.\n\nPeople were ringing me up, night and day. It appeared to me, you know what\nI thought? It appeared to me as though the red alert was the unification\npoint of humanity. Primal fear appears to stimulate the conscious mind's\nawareness as to the workings of its unconscious. The rational mind at this\npoint becomes confused at its discoveries which resemble, which resemble a\nperverse fascination with the subject of dread. In every case of a person\nsuccessfully establishing communication with me at the two times stated,\nthe only question their trembling voices wanted an answer to was: \"Is it\ngoing to happen?\"\n\nThe adrenaline induced by fear manifests the focal point of worship in the\nconscious mind! Naturally, as soon as the assault on the conscious mind\nfrom the external world subsides, the link with the unconscious is broken\nand in the case of Tripoli the entities or primal thought forms that exist\nthere, return to being superficially dormant. But now we have learnt that\na series of associated aural and visual images is all it requires to\nawaken such entities at will. If I had to condense the foremost aim of my\nmusical endeavours over the last eight years into one paragraph, I would\nsay that it has been to create a concrete vision of the future by\nsuggesting a spiralling recession of time. The regression of every aspect\nof existence to its original condition of primal substance. The term\n\"killing joke\" amplifies the idea of the laughter that dispels the\nultimate fear of returning to our base origin.\n\nNevertheless, we still have to learn that the climate of an age is\nunalterable. The changes we see before us must be recognised as natural\ngrowth, insofar as we can perceive nature or evolution to be. Therefore,\nno matter how we feel about the severity of such proliferation we cannot\nalter its direction. Therefore, one is forced to accept that all\nanalytical breakdowns of developments are obsolete.\n\nHave a look at it, imagine...\n\n\"The shipyards blaze, vibrant arsenals wait their turn. Idols of rational\nworld to worship power, to worship strength. Great crowds excited by riot,\npleasure and work. Insane crusades, destructive gestures of the freedom\nbringers. And all the bells shall toll as holy banners fly and all will\ntalk of freedom. Let rage and hate of races run from Adam down. The magic\nof our science shines brighter than a thousand suns. Liberty in new\ndimensions, ruthless and spectacular, obliteration shall be poetry of\n'Golden Dawns.'\n\n [note: this is taken verbatim from the lyrics to 'Rubicon']\n\nIt can be seen at this stage that all my conclusions are formulated on the\npremise that rationalism ultimately destroys itself through its own\nirrationality. We can actually prove this by utilising a sequential\nthought process for the elimination of supposed fact.\n\nNow, I turn this systemised regression for convenience sake. So let us all\nin the Courtauld Institute go into the future, and we shall go into the\nfuture by using reason:\n\n(A) History proves that war is an integral part of human existence.\n\n(B) The intellect neither alters nor detracts from the fact that man is an\naggressive and predatory beast.\n\n(C) The application of both intellect and science is therefore inevitably\nemployed for the purposes of tribal dominance.\n\n(D) The continual perfection and development of (C), which is the\napplication of both intellect and science, the perfection and development\nof this through time, for example the industrial revolution, rapidly\nevolving research et cetera, government funded, invariably culminates in\nsuper-weapons of total annihilation. The opposing bodies of government\nthat license such production become aware of the catastrophic implications\nof these instruments. Mutually assured destruction: MAD. And subsequently\njustify their deployment on the basis of deterrence. Now at this moment in\ntime we are precisely at (E).\n\nI shall explain (E). Weapon stockpiles increase at an alarming rate and\nsimilarly so do the law of averages for human or technological error,\ncoupled with conflicting ideological, economic and strategic gestures. And\nI warn you that the Zionists believe that it will come six months after a\nmajor peace agreement.\n [quiet: pff...it's rubbish.]\nSo weapon stockpiles\nincrease at an alarming rate and similarly so do the law averages for\nhuman or technological error, coupled with conflicting ideological,\neconomic and strategic gestures. The logical result of which would be:\n\n(F) An eventual thermo-nuclear exchange destroying approximately 93% of\nthe global population. Now, statistics assimilate that total extinction is\nstill highly unlikely. So, the surviving 7% will be distributed between:\nI) government fallout shelters containing sophisticated ecosystems, and 2)\nsmall islands of people scattered across the under populated regions of\nthe Southern Hemisphere.\n\nNow (G). These two modes of existence both rapidly transformed from their\nformer condition by being psychologically and physically exposed to\nextreme changes, logically\n [cymbal crash]\n, logically.\n\n(H) The former group (1) being subjugated to the confine of a subterranean\nexistence in a regimental fashion necessary for its own maintenance, it is\nlogical to conclude that with restricted natural resources taken into\nconsideration barbarism, cannibalism and separate factions will occur over\nan extended period of time. Now, in the long term we can see that the\npsychological aftermath of such repetitious brutality would assure a\ncomplete nullification of all previous remnants of reason. More\nimportantly the memory of the former civilisation would revert to\nmythological status.\n\nHa-ha.\n\n(I) The letter I, (I), the latter group, (2), reduced to a far baser level\nof civilisation, the radiated food, absence of energy, medicine, function\nof ecosystems, etc. would have inevitably experienced atrocities to the\nextent that their emotions would have been hardened to the point of\ntranquility. Now, this in conjunction with the effect of radioactive\nsubstances that appear to induce a modification of the genes in certain\nindividuals could support recent medical disclosures that if the protein\nin the gene is slightly affected, it can no longer produce certain acids\nwhich cause us to feel anxiety.\n\nSimilarly, we are forced to admit that over an extended period of time\nundetectable mutation would develop, giving us a terrestrial being of a\nconscious vertebrate type that is physically, spiritually, psychologically\nand fundamentally alien to our present condition. Again, the memory of the\nformer civilisation, which is the one you and I are sitting in now, would\nrevert to mythological or legendary status. I haven't finished.\n\nLetter (J) for \"Joke\".\n\nIn both cases the creation of a new humanity occurs at the diminishing\npoint of the age of reason. In both cases, though more significantly in\nthe latter, Man reaches a state that epitomises freedom in its most\nobjective context. In both cases the memory of the former civilisation\nreverts to legendary status. Now, in these examples we can observe that\nthe product of rationalism has created the perfect climate for the birth\nof a magical age or an irrational interpretation of existence if you like.\n\nSimultaneously, with a rudimentary equation of this process we cancel out\nthe necessity of the equation. And it subsequently disintegrates into\nnothingness. I'll demonstrate. The existence of reason plus the exclusive\nenhancement of reason equals the eventual and sudden breakdown of reason,\nwhich equals the creation of its antithesis, which is a magical\ninterpretation of existence.\n\nReason, it seems, is made void by its inefficiency at embracing and\nadequately explaining the exhilarating phenomenon of existence. Sure, it's\nimpossible to accurately estimate the repercussive effect on a future\nsociety that might arise from a consciousness that has witnessed and\nall-out atomic cataclysm first hand and survived.\n\nNow, seen in this light we are talking about a natural function, yes, a\nnatural function, that does not fall short of a global initiation\nperceived as a whole. A purification by ordeal. Possibly. The birth of a\nNew World; new consciousness; new Man. But we can only see this vision\nwith true objectivity if we continue to bind this objectivity into our\nexistence. When we almost become our vision. Must become!\n\nWhen we achieve polarity and we stand with our heads above the heavens and\nour feet below the hells. Stand upright. Now, much attention is given\nthese days to the work of H. P. Lovecraft whose fictional entity seems to\ncorrelate to the major shift in global trends. Only the other day I picked\nup a magazine that contained an article by one Peter Smith expanding on H.\nP. Lovecraft and the occult tradition. He says: \"Lovecraft is a\nparticularly interesting case of transmission via dream. He violently\ndenies the idea of the existence of occult phenomena. Nevertheless, this\ndenial is belied by the unconscious elements of his stories, indicating a\ndivision between the rational and intuitive side of his personality. With\nthe appearance of each story an underlying pattern becomes evident. 'All\nmy stories'. He wrote, 'unconnected as they may be, are based on the\nfundamental law or legend that this world was inhabited at once time by\nanother race who in practising, who in practising black magic lost their\nfoothold and were expelled, yet live on the outside, ever ready to take\npossession of this earth again.'\"\n\nNow, this is the central theme of 'The Call of Cthulhu' written in 1926.\n1926 that must be about, what, 12 years before, 12 years after the Aim of\nHorus which happened around the year 1904. I'm to understand. Correct me\nif I'm wrong. Don't bother.\n\nThe subject of the story is the idea that at certain times when the stars\nassume their correct position these dark powers can influence sensitive\nindividuals, giving them visions of the great Old Ones or, if they resist,\ndriving them insane.\n\n [synthesiser effect]\n\nThese entities exist in another dimension or vibrational level and can\nonly enter this world through a specific window area or psychic gateway, a\nconcept fundamental to many occult traditions. Lovecraft describes the\nworld after the return of the Old Ones: \"Mankind would become free and\nwild beyond good and evil with laws and morals thrown aside and all men\nshouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones\nwould teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel, and all the world\nwould flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom.\"\n\nThere is a marked similarity in this passage to the teachings of many\nsecret societies including the Assassins, the Gnostics and the Templars.\nBut in particular, to the law of Thelema as expressed by Lovecraft's\ncontemporary the very dubious character Aleister Crowley. Very dubious\ncharacter!\n\nThe main distinction between them, that is Lovecraft and Crowley, is a\nmoral one. Whereas Lovecraft regarded these ancient gods as essentially\nevil in nature, Crowley saw their return as being in full accord with the\nprogression of aeons which means it is, and it is to be.\n\nJust because I don't like thermo-nuclear power does not mean that it is\ngonna go away.\n\nEvidence shows the opposite. Just because I find these forces repugnant\ndoes not mean to say I will not come into contact with them. So my\nopinion, where do I stand upon this moral and ethical dilemma?\n\nThe first thought that comes to my mind is my beautiful little daughter,\nwho I love very much. Somewhere I tend to agree with H. P. Lovecraft. I\nmean, I find these entities, or should I say these changes, repugnant. I\nam in the end a romanticist. I still dream of the Cotswold Hills as I\nremember them in my childhood; the wildlife; the exquisite beauty of the\ncountryside on a hot English summer's day. But there is also something I\ncannot dismiss about Crowley's assumption that the return of these ancient\nforces are in a call with the progression of aeons, or the scheme of the\nuniverse if you like. And yes I believe somewhere we have a moral and\nethical responsibility to polarise or stabilise these forces with balance\nand truth. In fact, I have to go back to the ancient hills of the\nCotswolds to my homeland and to the religion which nourished me. \"Eight\nwords the Witches' Creed fulfill: if it harm none, do what thou will.\"\n\nI also believe that we can only respond to such changes on an individual\nbasis. As I am primarily a musician I have tried to achieve this balance\nwith my musical form. The harsh masculine force of change is typified by\ndissonance and discordance. This is neutralised by the feminine currents\nof harmony and melody. It is here, the contrast between the two, that I've\nfound my polarity.\n\nNow, I hear that one or two of you have travelled a very long distance to\nthis talk and I wanted it to be a, a non-profit occasion. And I thank you\nall for hearing me out, very much.\n\n [guitar stops playing]\n\nAs far as our future plans are concerned everything is tied up in our\nforthcoming album, 'Outside The Gate'. We have consciously written the\nmusic to celebrate one occasion for ourselves which is a performance of\nthe music in a location one hundred miles north of Ayers Rock in\nAustralia, on the edge of a precipice. Now, naturally such an event would\nbe filmed. Obviously there are a lot of arrangements and obstacles we have\nto cross before this objective can be realised. But there is a new Killing\nJoke, and we would like you to listen and read our recent work and judge\nus on the merits of that work only.\n\nThank you very much for hearing me out.\n\n [applause]"

I'd rather watch\n\nPeace of mind is my priority\n\nThe long winter is coming and instinct is telling me to fly towards the south\n\nI want to be in a place of beginnings, not endings!\n\nForget all your belongings - leave the city, come unto the ends of the earth with me"
