Bleeding for these eyes to remain shut in darkness.\nIn this conscious cycle I am trapped. Spare me this transient surge of chemical\nnausea, mimicking contentedness. Pressed into my forehead, these fingertips\nfail to comfort my mind. Comatose descension. My psyche withers and cracks as\nthe worm naked to the burning sun. Razor lined parasites that trace their way\nthrough my brain. I have harbored this virus inside my mind my whole life,\nwallowing in a pool of vomit. Inside my skull thoughts grow sore and begin to\ndecay, infected, swollen, and bursting. My jaw tightens into a clench. Cranial\npulse escalates to a pounding throb. I turn my focus inward, to be relieved by\nperpetual void. For we cannot attain in life the adoration we receive in death.\nI am glad to have died, and now that I am gone, I know only the dead truly\nrest."

              "lyrics": "Moss grew over my eyes, and the roots went to my brain, down my throat, through\nmy knees, and out my toes. There will be no salvation. A perspective struggles\nfor air, engulfed by the earth’s healing scab. Let the dirt pour from the\ninside of my skull, as I am excavated from the burning wreckage. My torso opens\nto reveal a mass grave, exhuming the skeletons buried in my chest. Why must\nthere be illumination upon this festering pile? Cursing that which wakes me. I\ncoil to make my nest, to hide my scales from the light. I have not yet had my\ntime in the sun. There will be no salvation, for I am the serpent doomed to\ncrawl on my stomach. Slithering beneath your feet and between your toes.\nLearning your minds, mimicking your frivolity. But all jubilation is mine in\nthe end. Basilisk fangs glistening in the sun’s final rays, to alleviate a\nradial hatred, ancient and hypnotic. Staining your lives and all the earth with\na bitterness, subtle and unbearable, yet tangible at the very base of your\nmind. A worm becomes a king. Arising to crush the crown of God. Eternally\ndispelling my misery to permeate through every molecule of life that pulses\nover this planet. The sun burns blinding red before eternally ceasing its\ngraceful shine. In a serpent’s mouth the earth shall be swallowed whole. And we\nwill ask ourselves before we finally die: How miserable is the light that\nshines into my eyes?"

It's just a feeling, this\nsensation that I get. Similar to the birth and growth of black cobras in my\nmouth. Where is the happiness you are to find inside yourself? The salt will\nnot cease to pour into your unlidded eyes. A surgery malicious, meticulous,\nripping you apart. Furious excavation. Don't tell me you don't need this. As we\nstand here, we can smell you rotting inside your beautiful tomb. A blank dead\nface stares at me. You have focused the whole of your existence upon a single\nthought. The depravity of our world. That we are all plagued. Voluntarily\nimpaling yourself on a spike of well intended nothingness. Your words are\nbeginning to rust into the guilt that rots inside us all, revealing your\npointless speculations as a disguise. The ordure you harbor inside your skull\nhas given nothing. Now this torment is only your torment, and it's salt to me.\nFinding poison in every flower and you wonder why they wilt with your touch,\nleaving your world empty until there is nothing left for you. My index finger\nis pointed directly at your pathetic heart. I'll be the one to close your eyes.\nI'll close your eyes when you die"

Eyelids sewn shut, stumbling away into a tangled spider web of agonizing\nbondage, while dripping fangs emanate from the walls. Fear is all around me.\nLords pull at robotic tendons guiding every subtle twitch of fingers, and\nthought is coffined, smothered beneath the loathsome. Conglomerations of\ndecaying offscourings amassing into a colossal mountain range, larger than the\nbiomass of the entire earth. Squeezed and contorted into the crafty wires.\nSlimed in a dripping sewage runoff coating. There, behind a snowy television\nscreen, bleeding in peeled human skin, snaked into the eye sockets of the\nevening viewer. With arms hanging limp over the side of the love seat,\npotassium chloride dribbles from the corners of our mouths. A puddle forms on\nthe dirt floor where comprehension and empathy dissolve. Coordinated like toys,\nbecoming blinded, stoic, acquisitive whores. Manipulation of the collective\nconsciousness pontificates a prayer for our country, entombed. Defining\nabominable. Extract the ticks burrowing deep into the brain stem. Together\nwe’ll eradicate the throne of our tormentors. …This is the delusion that I\nburned and I watch as its ashes decorate the ground. The manifestation of my\ndiscomfort and insecurities. I am relieved now that it has died. A\nmisperception of reality. Nothing more than a charred and stinking corpse,\nnailed to the cross next to the remains of a white, manufactured Christ."

And I laugh at this\nsand I hold in my hands. This, I used to think I held the key. The door was\nalways open. And I remain to stare at my reflection, as I am randomly switched\nback and forth from either side. My insignificance becoming insignificant. And\nall my pointless shouts at the universe fall back upon my skull like pelting\nrain. I smash my fist into the mirror until my body is soaked in blood. And I\nlaugh uncontrollably at this shattered reflection. I let my hands bleed as they\nfinally touch the truth. All the pain and torment. The sum of humanity’s\nsuffering. It was worth everything I have lost. To finally understand these\nbeautiful roses blossoming forth from the hollow torso of humanity’s blood\ndrenched history. I lost my tongue with the shards that splintered into my\nmind. I am not amused. Bloodlet my skull now. Acid rain on my lungs. Ending all\nlife now. I stand on God. Drain this world from my eyes. My insignificance has\nbecome insignificant."
