              "lyrics": "I will hand you your heart\nWhich I will so gracelessly rip from your heaving chest.\nI pondered in candlelit lethargy. I grieved as the wax melted,\nKnowing...\n\"Tomorrow I must hurt you, who I hold dear\nAs an ancient myth held true to its people.\nYou, who I knew but a moment. But what a moment!\nAs though touching the darkening hue of the night sky\nAnd forsaken stars for the first time.\nTogether and alone,\nWe came to swim in each other's minds.\nIndependent, still one.\nNow I must be rid of you.\nForever is a choice made by both.\nFather Time is dreaming of fog rising and moonsets.\nThese we cannot see again through a reflective cyclopean gaze.\nNothing good.\nFor me.\nNothing is good. But for you?\nOne day there will be no one at all\nWith whom to talk, speak or boast.\nBy no fault, with no blame, but with one hundred points of pain.\nDon't forget. Cannot forget. Nothing was good.\nNo future. Smile politely at the blind.\"\nHave I known hate? Indifference in a skincloak of anger\nOr Love in purity. Goddess, the torment! The weak talk of strength.\nThe strong speak with sympathy. The wise thus said nothing.\nFor none know the real truth... the strong need and the wise know it.\nWhen stabbed endless times all vessels are cut\nAnd the heart will lumber with Death.\nThe mind becomes stricken with sickly pallor\nAnd will usher in Hate.\nWill the blade sayeth,\n\"Please, I wish not to dive into your flesh!\"\nWhen all are gone?\nInfinite dirge, a life in Inferno's anguish.\nMy tears ever stream\nAnd will they run separately from my blood?\nWill it be this and Now?"

It is a word too freely flung about\nFrom the ignorant mouths of those who do not know\nWhat it is like to be haunted by a freezing, torturous gale,\nAnd to be forced to hold the withered hand of eternal pain.\nWhere Nothing symbolizes Anything...\n\nMy demons have fled for they did not know that which I am.\n\nI am this and nothing more\nI am Black Death, I am crimson hate\nI am Mary and the wicked Whore\nEnthroned on abyssic stormclouds in burning skies...\nI am this and something more\nI am the rape of winter, I am the crush of ice\nI am fear incarnate, the stygian cold you abhor\nEngraved on Olympian stone in kingly majesty...\nI am this and so much more.\n\nMy angel has arrived and she will soon learn who she is."

Hiding inside and astounding me with devotion accompanied by dissonant bells of betrayal.\nMy head on a pike like a little horsey on a pink stick with plastic tassels and you ride us into the raging sunset,\nOr so I thought... until I discovered my flesh ablaze and the sick smell of perfume and kerosene.\nA one legged ant under your magnifying glass, I became scorched by loving stupidity and individuality.\nI had to choose the special one, the unique that stood boldly alone and winked a wicked wink of \"Like\".\nI thought myself Midas and you would miraculously turn golden and be fixed but you remained distraught and ashen.\nSomeone for everyone... but none for the two of us.\nWe, the rulers of a cursed sea full of leeches and remoras, eating bits and pieces of our corrupt sanity.\nStability? Ha! Normality? Even a greater comedy!\nWhat is friendship among lovers but clinging to fleeting memories of transitory emotions?\nNow you've invited the demons in for afternoon tea and contractual renegotiations.\nThe one of duality makes its carnal bed in our house and schemes with Morpheus, the first son of Sleep.\n\nI dreamed of the rape of your mother while you watched in terror and I clutched the breasts of youth and infirmity.\nI ever so lightly touched you with two fingers as you clenched your thighs tight and said,\n\"No, you I will not defile, though wanton and warm.\"\nWhen it was time to dine, you were stolen away in reluctant abandon for protection from an idiot ordained with knowledge."

Feed our armies with your children\nPerish for our greatness, throw your meaningless lives away!\n\nDirges sing for the nameless\nWe who are erased\nSave our honour\nSpit in the face of the victor\n\nFrom empty steppe\nThey came to curse our lives\nBlood spilling reavers\nTo burn our homes and take our wives\n\nObey! Drones in columns, hundreds deep\nCrack on whips of oppression! Tear the spirit from these men\nToil! In earthly forges work until your end!\nPray to funeral gods for mercy, quick and painless death!\n\nTyrants, your sins shall never be forgiven\nHear the call to insurrection sound\nEnvenomed blades shall rip into your backs\nCruellest death shall visit on your sons\n\nLords, makers, prayers fall silent\nScourge, plague, hunger and blackest defeat\nThousand strong, ride from distant horizon\n\nBringing Scythian Death"

Many had lost their boots\nBut limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots\nOf tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.\n\nGas! Gas! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling,\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time;\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling\nAnd flound’ring like a man in fire or lime...\nDim, through the misty panes and thick green light,\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\n\nIn all my dreams, before my helpless sight,\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\n\nIf in some smothering dreams you too could pace\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in,\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face,\nHis hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory,\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est\nPro patria mori."
