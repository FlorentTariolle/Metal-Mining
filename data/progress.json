Die Zunge brennt – LUCIFER ES!!!\n\nWir regieren die Dämonen, Heerscharen aus Fleisch und Blut\nWir befehlen, sie erschlagen ihres Gleichen, ihre Brut.\nEin Kampf zum Licht und Mord für Gott, Verstümmlung aller Menschlichkeit\nDenn Frieden wird mit Tod bezahlt. Der Teufel wohnt in Dir allein.\n\nUnd Flammen schlagen aus dem Maul,\nSchwarze Galle höhlt den Knochen\nGift tropft schwer von jeder Silbe\nDie aus seinem Leib gekrochen"

Wake up you are the reason we sail into the lights. Wake up this ship is sinking. We won't make it out alive."

You moved the strings and the puppets danced on. The mountain we built wasn't yours to own. These pockets you lined were yours alone. The people you've used you bled to the bone. Your world will come crashing down. You wave your wand and people will follow. But you're not used to this. So get down and swallow. The pieces fall from the mirror. Prepare yourself to descend. The reflections becoming clearer. Close your eyes, this is the end. Your mouths writing cheques that your body can't cash. How long do you think that this can really last? I'd like to see your face when this is done. Take a step back cut your losses and run. The pieces fall from the mirror. Prepare yourself to descend. The reflections becoming clearer. Close your eyes this is the end. This is the end. This is the end of everything. This is the end of everything. Let's say a prayer to forgive and forget. Get on your knees there's no time for regret. Now take the lords hand and close your eyes. The burn you feel is met with a smile."

Stick in the sand to mark out our legacy, cut short by the unknown. Tides rise above you now, washed away, not yet fully grown. Deceive me, this life was torn away. Retrieve all the things that make this a better day! Just once now, I'd like to say, retrieve all the things that make this a better day! Growing up was the time of our lives, every day we watch the world go by. We were raised to be kings. Never fearing the vicious lullaby. Blinded by fate and virtue, watching life get torn from our arms, I'm standing, waiting now. Life's warrior bound to be disarmed. Deceive me, this life was torn away. Retrieve all the things that make this a better day! Just once now, I'd like to say, retrieve all the things that make this a better day! My story falls on deaf ears. The glory stalled for all these years. My candle burnt, the light appears. In death we see truth, twisted tale of sweetened memories. What I'd give to have you back here standing next to me. The unknown beast of fate, the vicious one casts out one last cry. I know you're watching me, the eagle soars until the last one dies. Deceive me, this life was torn away. Retrieve all the things that make this a better day! Just once now, I'd like to say, retrieve all the things that make this a better day!"

To rise so quickly out of haste, will lead to destruction of your fate. You'll see your enemies ascend, as your intentions come to an end. Reclaiming, reclaiming all that I was before. Replacing, replacing the broken with the strength to carry on. The walls are falling in on me. Through the eyes of a wolf I will see. My breath in cold air haunting who I want to be. Searching for the destiny of kings. Living on broken wings. We're living on broken wings. The walls are falling in on me. Through the eyes of a wolf I will see.

A tortured soul as daylight fades. Don't you give up on me now. I've never let you go and I never will. Don't you give up on me now. I've never let you go and I never will. I never thought that you could sink so low. Now I can see the light that you see. 'Til the end, 'til the death. This is forever. Upon the tides you will scream. 'Til the end, 'til the death. This is forever. Time still remains. These broken words can't save the day. Fate to be explained. A tortured soul as daylight fades. Let's go to a place I know, where the familiar sting allows me to let go. If I could take it all back, I would give it all away. The clothes on my back, the tears of yesterday.

A year and a half I'll never get back, all because you secretly smoked the crack. Fire it up, breathe it in, exhale out. Filled with rage, temper climbs to boiling point now. Fire it up, breathe it in, exhale out. But after all that's said and done the last laugh is mine. It's easy to forget, but you can't leave it alone. You destroyed everything, just like a cyclone (Psycho). I never gave up. I never gave in. You're gonna pay for all the shit that you did. You walked into my life and fucked not only mine. You are the biggest mistake that this world can contrive. Fire it up, breathe it in exhale out. Filled with rage, temper climbs to boiling point now. Fire it up, breathe it in, exhale out.

Let go, let go.\n\nStay silent at least for now, and let me move on.\n'Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart\nI've been around the world and back for you, and now its time to choose.\n\nI've been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life.\nI'm damaged from the inside. I've been broken.\nDon't threaten me with what you think I feel.\nIf you could read my mind you'd be in tears.\n\nI'm sick of your excuses you hold above me.\nI've finally come to terms with what I am.\nI'm nothing in your eyes, and this will not change.\nI'm living in a dream.\n\nStay silent at least for now, and let me move on.\n'Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart\nI've been around the world and back for you, and now its time to choose.\n\nAnd I'll close my eyes, and dream of a better time\nwhen I'll be finally past this and I'll be happy on my own.\nI've done all I can, and I've still been cast aside.\nAll I ever wanted to be was be the one who would wipe those tears from your eyes.\nBut I guess I'll play second best, to a world that will never care about you.\nYou'll never understand you're just another pretty face\nYou'll tell me that you care, and then run straight back to him.\nI can hear your voice of treason from a mile away.\n\nYou never did know how to whisper.\n\nYou're such a liar. Tell me the truth.\nYou're such a liar. Tell me the truth.\nYou're such a liar. Tell me the truth.\nDo the world a favor, stop cutting your arms, and slit your throat."

Did it ever matter either way?\n\nHow could I ever doubt, the only thing I could never live without?\n\nAnd what if all the dreams we've carried are dead and buried,\nDoes it fall on me? Did it ever matter either way?\nI could have thrown it all away with nothing to show for all of the years,\nBut I've always known that my dreams will outlive all of my fears.\n\nWell never be alone, well never be alone.\nYou'll never be alone, you'll never be alone.\n\nAnd what if all the dreams we carried are dead and buried,\nDoes it fall on me? Did it ever matter either way?\nI could have thrown it all away with nothing to show for all of the years,\nBut I've always known that my dreams will outlive all of my fears.\n\nAll alone, all one this broken heart will bring me home.\nThis heart will not rest easy.

When it rains it pours.\nIt's raining even harder now. I can't sleep, can't forget how your voice sounds.\nAnd the way that you looked at me, you made me somebody.\n\nAnd if I have to miss you, I swear I'll make you proud.\nI won't let this go to my head, You're never gonna be just another\nface in the crowd.\nCause I know where ever I go you'll be there in spirit.\nYour name still rings in every note that I sing, And I hope you can hear it.\n\nCause I've been waking up alone for so long and all that I know is,\nWhen it rains it pours. When it rains it pours.\nIt's raining even harder now. I can't sleep, can't forget how your voice sounds.\nAnd the way that you looked at me, you made me somebody.\n\nHow long will half of my heart be enough?\nWe're oceans apart, and this might be too much to ask,\nBut I meant it when I told you, you gave me something to come home to.\nSo I'll hold these notes as long as these words still hold their weight,\nHope will be an anchor holding us into place.\n\nAnd I've been waking up alone for so long and all that I know is,\nThis is my heart. This is my home. And when it rains it pours.\nIt's raining even harder now. I can't sleep, can't forget how your voice sounds.\n(Don't tell me that the distance, will never make a difference.)\nAnd the way that you looked at me, you made me somebody.\n(Cause it makes the heart grow fonder. It makes the heart grow fonder.)\nIt makes the heart grow fonder. It makes the heart grow fonder"

Nothing but slurry clogging the gutters of decent folk who can't be reassured by empty platitudes of a clean sky. This is all rot. And oh, how we dance and pirouette amongst it all. Wouldn't dream of feigning smiles whilst carrying your dead weight through life's circus. A fête worse than death. So the carrion birds will feign whispers in raucous, howling tones as they build worthless futures amongst these bones...\n\nIf this is human nature, concrete it over. And have done. Just have done.\n\nI like to play in open graves. The crawling things raise their fists and howl. I find that the soil clogs my throat in just such a way / as to drag the vowels through a twist of ruptured bowel; to rise, then decay, then away. Consonant cosmonauts choking on delay.\nThe vultures have it right, sailing in under cover of night.\nOr staring you straight out in glare of day.\nThey'll have your eyes away so as you don't need to blink the tears past.\n\nOne foot wrong versus this precipice - you're at least six feet down.\nCan you wiggle your toes? Let's fucking go.\nThe all-consuming boogie of nucleus versus the rest of it.\nIf the weather balloons we're all fucked.\n\nNever was much one for recall. Cells is cells is cells is cells.\n\nWe could idle here whilst I rhyme that with Hel, but I'm sure we've all got shapes to throw.\nLet us stumble through the opening lines.\nLet us dance for the sake of the fact that once we can't we'll all be damned well wish we had.\n\nI'm still toying with all the gods of men.\nI don't let them push me around.\nWe've been around and around and around.\nAwaiting our chance to populate holes in the ground."

Gathering fallen limbs of masters past 'til mind's eye finally fades out; blinded by final death of the Root. I shall gather my strength amongst the remnants of my kin and build a bonfire against the eternal, twisting night. The never ending frost plumed night.\n\nI shall raise nought but sparks against the coal shrine pitch, but as we gather here against the end, those sparks will grid our honour. Sparks to kindling to roaring flame, pyres of the mind starting up again. Death may be inevitable, but we can at least ride his trail, grim determination as fortification - dancing through the mires, raising surprised rainbows against the night.\n\nAll coiled as serpents gathering to strike at the light. One last dance amongst the embers. To lay down with the others before the dawn should chance to come. For this blood, the end of the line.\n\nWould you hear me? Carrion, wanderer. Echoing chamber of void.\n\nSo it's an endless funeral, or so it would seem. It's all furnace flames and clods of earth and endless weeping. Oh the fucking weeping. I could almost cry.\n\nAll the mourners and their mournings; all black veils and emotion unveiled. Shut up and get in the ground. The worms aren't complaining - they'll make a hearty meal of yours.\n\n...and the rest of you, I'm sure. Get in the fucking ground.\n\nI'll take up a shovel and hazard a grin. If you don't yet know the drill, well i'll fill you in.\nIt's a dark old life on the whole, so step right up and down you go.\n\nMisplaced apology nailed to contradiction - I'm not worshiping that! A life spent seeking balance; perhaps my spirit's just not level. Always angling towards Hell. Catch of the day not worth a glance past nightfall.\n\nDancing with the Devil whilst throwing money to the spirit lenders. Sale or return you can keep it. This is not a percentage decrease in decomposition.\n\nYou can dance around my tombstone all you like but I'll be grabbing your fucking ankle as and when I please.\n\nI may not be the lord of the dance you ridiculous cunts, but I'll have my tuppence worth, don't you worry. One for each eye if you please."

Still they march, endlessly. The man reaches his hands into the soil and finds a weak, glowing light.]\n\nUnder a dim lit sky shadows marched like statues.\nDarkness was coursing throughout their veins, and light shone from their eyes.\nAnd it was all they had, but it was not enough to light their way: A silent march into awaiting graves.\n\nTurned my back against the night, toward the hope that there’s a place where truth abides.\nFor here we’re left to wonder why we douse the flame and there is nothing left inside.\n\nWe have become as the ravens; mighty in numbers and blocking out the sun...the sun.\n\nAnd here my will could never contend: Is this not cold and bent?\nAnd where does my volition fit in? Where?\n\nToo weak to wade amongst the dead, too tired to stand amongst the rest.\n\nSo face the sky and tell me how you gauge living in vain?\nShow me the crooked and bent, the shape of contempt...\nof...contempt...of...contempt...of contempt.\n\nWe’ve buried the flame, but I contend to dig it up again."

It goes both ways, whether you believe in a higher power or not. It is a crippling fear which leaves us pinned to close-mindedness, and keeps us from ever being able to see beyond our prejudices and preconcieved beliefs. The man stands at the gate of the way he wants to see the world, and the way it truly is. If Truth exists, it exists outside of us, and we have no say in shaping it or reshaping it to fit in our boxes.]\n\nFor too long we have lived in a confounded state of being, with nothing to lessen\nthe sting of knowing that all toil and gain is just the ebb and flow of time.\n\nWas it all a lie?\n\nWe fail every time we let this fear inside – reason given way to overarching pride.\nBy our own design we were led astray. Crossing ageless lines. Blind men led the way.\n\nWe hold to whatever makes us safe as if Truth was all too much to take.\nWe crawl like shadows in the night. The illusion fades with morning’s light.\n\nWe will fail every time we let this fear inside.\nWe must open our hearts to look beyond ourselves,\nthen we’ll understand that all of us can see everything as day,\na light to guide the way, a reason for today.\n\nWe say... Are these the words of God, or reflections of mine?\nWill I find that path, or just circle around, damned to the unknown?"

Our first breath is as our last. Our first breath is as our last.\n\nAnd will the heavens still shine without our gaze?\nAnd will the seasons still pass if there’s no one to count the days?\n\nWe fade like the summer leaves in fall, then drift with the winters wind.\nAnd still we thought that we were gods, but we’re nothing more than a grain of sand in time.\n\nWe’ve conquered everything, these minds and these machines.\nBy our hands the earth stops its spin, and with our will it begins again.\nBut when the mountains turn to dust, and the rivers all run dry,\nwhen my final breath has come and gone, this place will carry on.\n\nWe are nothing more than grains of sand on the shores of time."

He\nprobably stood with his eyes closed, looking concentrated. But\nVerdell knew that Louis was pretending, it was all part of a play, to\nhim this was nothing.\nA lonely snare drum began to patter in the air. Verdell stood up.\n\"Idiots\", he screamed and started running towards the tent.\n\nThe manager saw him coming\nBut he never had a chance to react\n\nThat was the day when he witnessed\nHow one of his own completely ruined his work\n\nA clown that's filled with hate\nIt cannot be that great\n\nHe cries like a madman\nHe smells like a beer can\nIntentions are good though\nTo finish a bad show\nHe tears down a wall, he smashes props to pieces\nJugglers join in, that's how the chaos increases\nEveryone runs\n\nAnd manager Leo went crazy\nWhen Louis released all the animals free\n\nThat was the day when it happened\nThey fooled and screwed him in every single way\n\nA face that's filled with tears\nA dream that disappears\n\nHe cries like a madman\nHe smells like a beer can\nIntentions are good though\nTo finish a bad show\nHe tears down a wall, he smashes props to pieces\nJugglers join in, that's how the chaos increases\n\nNoble indeed, yes\nThey must be brainless\nThe band, they are staying\nA.C.T keeps on playing\nThe show must go on, let's do a middle section\nTime for the band to give you an erection\nShow must go on..."

He had been beaten, then he had\nwoken up in this cage, probably as a punishment. But a punishment\nfor what? He didn't understand. What had he done?\nAt a distance, he could see Louis coming towards him. Louis sat\ndown close to the cage.\n\"What have they done to you?\" Louis whispered while patting the\ncreature on the head. The creature made a deep sound and shook\nhis head. Louis nodded.\n\"There's nothing to understand, he's an idiot, a very bad person\",\nLouis said and looked at the other cages. \"Just look at my animals.\"\nLouis sighed.\n\"We need to get you out of here.\"\nThe creature made another sound, and Louis replied:\n\"I know, this whole place is broken, it is falling apart, it's falling to pieces.\"\n\nA tent that's filled with holes\nRaised by broken homesick souls\nOn a field that is somewhere far away from here\n\nA constant drunken clown\nA freak that has been beaten down\nWhat they share, a pent-up anger deep inside\n\nAll alone in the dark they weep\nThey turn around in their worried sleep\nThey're passengers on a sinking ship\nIt's the end of a lifelong trip\n(They all know)\nIt will crack!\nIt will fall!\nIt will not hold!\n\nAnimals are chained\nSome of them are sick and drained\nIn a cage a lion licks his new whip wounds\n\nThe leader will demand\nEven though you are injured, stand!\nThat is how they bring in money for the show\n\nAll alone in the dark they weep\nThey turn around in their worried sleep\nThey're passengers on a sinking ship\nIt's the end of a lifelong trip\n(They all know)\nIt will crack!\nIt will fall!\nIt will not hold!\n\nEverything's falling, falling to pieces\nThey try to hold out\nTry to hold out, but they're broken\nEverything's falling, falling to pieces\nThey try to hold out\nTry to hold out, but they're broken\n\nMoving on from town to town\nThey're building up, they're tearing down\nA shifting landscape, but the pain's the same\n\nAll alone in the dark they weep\nThey turn around in their worried sleep\nThey're passengers on a ship\nIt's the end of a lifelong trip\n(They all know)\nIt will crack!\nIt will fall!\nIt will not hold!\n\nEverything's falling, falling to pieces\nThey try to hold out\nTry to hold out, but they're broken\nEverything's falling, falling to pieces\nThey try to hold out\nTry to hold out, but they're broken\n\n(Nobody hears them and nobody sees them\nTry to hold out 'cause it's all that they know)"

But this particular\nnight she had grabbed him in his arm and pulled him back to\nhis room. \"You are not a kid anymore\", she said when she closed\nthe door behind her. When he was lying there, back in his own\nbed, with a blanket over his head trying to sleep, he heard a voice.\n\"Louis\".\n\nHe sat up and stared at the door at the end of the room. The room\nwas completely dark apart from a small beam of light coming\nfrom the keyhole Something was moving outside, he could see the\nlight shifting in the hole. Louis swallowed.\n\"Who's there?\" he asked with a whisper.\n\"Loooouiiiisssss.\"\nSomething hit the door and all his blood rushed to the top of his\nhead.\nMom, he thought.\n\"Not mom Louis, it's me\", someone replied and Louis heard a scraping\nsound against the door. Louis wanted to run, but he couldn't\nmove.\n\"Food, Louis. Food.\" More hitting on the door.\nLouis screamed.\n\"Mom!\"\n\nAmong the animals backstage\nAt safe distance from the cage\nTwo workers looked upon the beast\nThis will be tough to say the least\n\nLouis the tamer\nRemarkable man indeed\nWith just one movement, a look or elusive sound\nHe gets them right where he wants\n\nIt can't be done, he'll need a year\nThere's not a chance he'll tame that bear\nYou know that thing is pretty mean\nIt was the biggest thing they'd seen\n\nLouis the tamer\nHe's such a peculiar man\nThere is a saying\nThat he can tame anything\nEven your unwilling wife\n\nLooking like us\nBut moving like them\nThey listen, they nod\nThey understand\n\nIf you come close\nYou'll see it clear\nHe listens, they speak\nHe's one of them\n\nLions, whales\nFoolish snails\nBeavers, guppies\nStupid puppies\n\nHe tames them all\nA truly gifted man\n\nFrom out of nowhere he appeared\nA big white smile, a brown thick beard\nHe said: \"One minute, not a year, you humans just don't see\nthings clear\"\n\nLouis released him\nThat drooling and growling bear\nWith just one gesture\nHe got him to calm his mind\nThey walked away hand in hand\n\nLooking like us\nBut moving like them\nThey listen, they nod\nThey understand\n\nIf you come close\nYou'll see it clear\nHe listens, they speak\nHe's one of them\n\nCats and dogs\nNasty frogs\nRats, albinos\nFilthy rhinos\n\nHe tames them all\nA truly gifted man\n\nLouis the tamer\nRemarkable man indeed\nWith just one movement, a look or elusive sound\nHe gets them right where he wants\n\nLooking like us\nBut moving like them\nThey listen, they nod\nThey understand\n\nIf you come close\nYou'll see it clear\nHe listens, they speak\nA truly gifted man"

No one saw me, no one has realized that I've escaped.\nThe coldness from the hard stonewalls doesn't bother me. The difficult\ndecision that lies before me weigh heavily upon my shoulders.\nA possibility of a fate far worse? Darkness and anxiety increase\nand sharpen my senses. The evening dew makes the air do damp\nand cold, allowing my breath to create tiny, white veils that surround\nme - or is it something else? Sense a presence that doesn't\nscare. My heart's not pounding anymore, calmness rinses through\nmy body and I clasp my hands, collecting myself in hopes for an answer.\n\nI cry out to you, like I've done many times before\nI hope you listen to my prayer tonight\nI'm in desperate need of help. I can't decide all by myself\nThe crossroad's here, which path shall I stride?\n\nI've been watching you since the day that I died\nCan you not feel my love just breeze by your side?\nBut I can not help you to make that choice 'cause your destiny is sealed.\nMy heart, my son.\n\nHow can I go back? Meeting just pain and misery\nNo one should live the life that I do\nBut what will wait ahead? Maybe something even worse?\nGod! Try to see it from my point of view\n\nI've been watching you since the day that I died\nCan you not feel my love just breeze by your side?\nBut I can not help you to make that choice 'cause your destiny is sealed.\nMy heart, my son.\n\nLife is not fair, I should have told you all along from the start\nYou have to go back, he needs your help, he is your father\n\nThere's no choice. He'd do it for me"

It's just\nlying there, refusing to catch fire while the wood is cracking and glowing.\nI can no longer discern my face in my dreams. All I see is the white\nmask, the round red nose and the painted smile. I look at the clown\nin my dream. He laughs at me and says that he is me. Then he asks\nme to pull the wig. I do, but it won't come off. The more I tear the\nmore he laughs.\n\"See what I have become\", he says, and gives me a sad facial expression.\nThen he points at his face. Tears are running down his cheeks, I\nlean forward and start licking them. When I feel that taste I close my\neyes. His tears taste like alcohol.\n\"Take it easy\", he says and pushes me away. \"If you continue it will\nbe impossible to separate us\".\nBut he doesn't stop crying. His tears are just pouring down and\nmessing up his makeup. I can't stop myself. I grab his neck and pull\nhim towards me. Once again I start licking his cheeks, greedily\ndrinking from him. I lick his face all the way up to his eyes. Inside\nmy head I hear him laughing.\n\"There you go\", he says, and then he's gone.\nI turn around but it's all dark.\n\"You see\", he says inside my head. \"Now we're one.\"\n\nThey found him lying down in a corner\nThey woke him up and helped him get dressed\nNobody bothered, just part of the daily routine\nTo get the worn-out clown ass on stage\n\nHe fell and mumbled something unchhristian\nGot up and started doing his thing\nChildren were laughing, the ringmaster rubbing his hands\nRegardless of the state he still was...\n\nThe funniest man alive\nA genius lunatic, charmingly mad and bizarre\nFor certain he is number one\nWhen he's not around\nThey say he's just a tragic drunken clown\n\nhe dropped his curly wig on the wet grass\nHe leaned against the fence and threw up\nHe's breathing was heavy and mentally he was done\nAnother day at the circus my friends\n\nHe heard how they began to approach him\nHe turned around and straightened his back\nHe gave them his famous, infectious trademarked smile\nHalf-hidden under messed up makeup\n\nThe funniest man alive\nA genius lunatic, charmingly mad and bizarre\nFor certain he is number one\nWhen he's not around\nThey say he's just a tragic drunken clown\n\n\"Hey, my little friend\", he greeted a kid\nBut the child took a step back and said to his mom:\n\"Mom, I think there's something wrong with the clown\"\n\"Yes, there is, now let's go\"\nThen he fell to the ground\n\nHe sat down on the grass, he was tired\nHis bottle had been smashed in the fall\nBut that was not why he was crying"
