Das Fleisch so schwach, die Lust so groß.\nBelüg` Dich nicht – LUCIFER ES!!! Der Wille ließ das Böse los.\n\n„Weh aber der Erde und dem Meer! Denn der Teufel kommt zu euch hinab und hat (einen) großen Zorn,\ndenn er weiß, er hat wenig Zeit“\n\nEin Leichenberg auf guter Erde türmt sich auf zum Erdendach\nUnd jede Stufe meint Vergebung heißt es, denn die Zunge sprach\nVon ihrer Kanzel, von ihrem Thron besessen als Propheten des\nLichts, der Güte – Gottes Sohn. Die Zunge brennt – LUCIFER ES!!!\n\nWir regieren die Dämonen, Heerscharen aus Fleisch und Blut\nWir befehlen, sie erschlagen ihres Gleichen, ihre Brut.\nEin Kampf zum Licht und Mord für Gott, Verstümmlung aller Menschlichkeit\nDenn Frieden wird mit Tod bezahlt. Der Teufel wohnt in Dir allein.\n\nUnd Flammen schlagen aus dem Maul,\nSchwarze Galle höhlt den Knochen\nGift tropft schwer von jeder Silbe\nDie aus seinem Leib gekrochen"
